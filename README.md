# MemScope v1.0.1 - Memory Monitoring Addon for Ashita v4

A memory monitoring tool that tracks per-addon Lua memory, process memory, and provides growth analysis with historical trends.

## Features

- **Process Memory Tracking** - Working set, page file, and peak usage via Windows APIs (FFI)
- **Per-Addon Memory Breakdown** - Polling via `/addon list` capture with silent interception
- **Historical Trends** - Ring buffer storage with configurable history (720 process samples, 120 per addon)
- **Growth Observation** - EMA (exponential moving average) of delta to observe sustained memory changes
- **Spike Observation** - Informational alerts on sudden memory increases (% threshold + minimum absolute change)
- **GC Monitoring** - Track garbage collection events and freed memory (this addon's Lua state only)
- **ImGui Dashboard** - Real-time visualization with charts, sortable tables, and compact mode
- **Export to Excel** - Session data exported as `.xls` with multiple worksheet tabs
- **Pre-allocated Buffers** - Ring buffers, object pools, cached chart data (zero per-frame allocation)

## Dashboard Sections

### Process Memory
- **Working Set** - Physical RAM pages mapped into the process
- **Committed** - Virtual memory committed (RAM + swap reserved)
- Progress bars show usage vs the process virtual address limit (2 GB or 4 GB with LAA)
- Hover for peak values, deltas, and system memory info

### Lua Memory
- MemScope's own Lua state memory (this addon only)
- All loaded addons combined total (from `/addon list` — Lua-tracked memory only, see Data Accuracy below)
- GC collection statistics (count and last freed amount — MemScope's own GC only)

### Addon Breakdown
Sortable, scrollable table (click column headers to sort). Displays up to 10 rows before scrolling, with frozen header row:
- **Name** - Addon name (color-coded: orange=growth alert, green=self)
- **Memory** - Current Lua-tracked memory (excludes FFI/ImGui/C++ allocations)
- **Status** - Running/Ok/Unloaded
- **Delta** - Memory change per second (green=decreasing, red=increasing)
- **Trend** - UP/DOWN/FLAT based on EMA of delta (may reflect normal LuaJIT behavior)

Click any row for detailed stats and mini-chart. Right-click unloaded addons to remove from tracking.

### Memory Charts
- Process working set over time
- All addons combined total over time (displayed in MB)
- Time scale shown below each chart

### Compact Mode
Minimal overlay showing just the working set bar, top 3 addons, and pause/expand buttons. Toggle via the Compact button or `/memscope compact`. Window size restores automatically when expanding back to full mode.

### Reset UI
Use the **Reset UI** button (bottom-right) or `/memscope resetui` to restore the window to its default size and position.

## Alert System

**Alerts are disabled by default** because most triggers are false positives from normal LuaJIT behavior (see Data Accuracy below). Enable them in Settings if you want informational notifications during addon development.

### Growth Observation
Triggers when an addon shows sustained memory increase:
- Default threshold: 50.0 KB/sec (raised to reduce false positives)
- Uses EMA (exponential moving average) of delta for responsive trend tracking
- Requires 3+ samples before trend calculation begins
- **NOTE**: LuaJIT compiles hot paths into machine code, which increases Lua memory. This is normal and expected — not a leak.

### Spike Observation
Triggers on sudden memory jumps:
- Default threshold: 100% increase between polls
- Also requires minimum absolute change (default 512 KB)
- Prevents false alarms from small addons with large percentage swings
- **NOTE**: LuaJIT hot-path compilation can cause legitimate one-time jumps.

## Export

`/memscope export` creates a SpreadsheetML `.xls` file in the `exports/` directory. Opens natively in Excel and LibreOffice with multiple worksheet tabs:

- **Session** - Metadata (date, duration, LAA status, system RAM) + addon summary table
- **Process Timeline** - Full process memory history with timestamps
- **Addons Timeline** - Wide format with one column per addon (all addons side-by-side)
- **Per-Addon Tabs** - One tab per addon with metadata header, timeline, deltas, and change-from-start

## Settings

Access via the **Settings** button in the dashboard:

| Setting | Default | Range | Description |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| Sample Interval | 5 sec | 1-30 | How often to collect process memory data |
| Addon Poll Interval | 30 sec | 5-120 | How often to query per-addon memory via /addon list |
| Show Process Memory | true | | Display process memory bars |
| Show Addon Breakdown | true | | Display addon table |
| Show Charts | true | | Display history charts |
| Chart Height | 80 px | 40-150 | Height of chart widgets |
| Enable Alerts | false | | Show growth/spike notifications in chat (off by default — most are false positives) |
| Growth Threshold | 50.0 KB/s | 1-200 | Sustained growth rate for informational alert |
| Spike Threshold | 100% | 25-200 | Sudden increase percentage for spike alert |
| Spike Min Change | 512 KB | 64-2048 | Minimum absolute change for spike alert |
| Auto GC Monitoring | true | | Track garbage collection events |

## Data Accuracy

- Per-Addon Memory (Understated)
	- The memory values from `/addon list` only reflect **Lua-tracked memory** — what the Lua VM allocates for tables, strings, functions, and other Lua objects. The following are **NOT included**:
		- **FFI allocations** (`ffi.new`, `ffi.C.*` calls) — allocated outside the Lua GC
		- **ImGui resources** — textures, fonts, draw lists managed by the Addons plugin
		- **Manual C allocations** — anything allocated by native code on behalf of the addon
		- **Addons plugin internals** — the Addons plugin's own overhead per loaded addon
	- This means actual addon memory usage is typically **higher** than what MemScope reports.
- Working Set (Overstated on Win10/11)
	- Windows 10 and 11 **inflate Working Set values** compared to actual usage. The OS holds onto memory pages aggressively and delays releasing them, even when the process no longer needs them. Use the **Trim** button in the toolbar (or `/memscope trim`) to force a working set trim — actual usage is typically much lower. This uses the same `SetProcessWorkingSetSize(-1, -1)` technique from atom0s's `freemem` addon. The OS will page memory back in as needed — trimming is safe and non-destructive.
- GC Monitoring (MemScope Only)
	- Each Ashita addon runs in its own **isolated Lua state** with a separate garbage collector. The GC statistics shown by MemScope only reflect MemScope's own Lua VM. There is no way to trigger or observe GC in other addons from Lua.
- Growth Alerts (Informational Only)
	- LuaJIT compiles frequently-executed Lua code ("hot paths") into machine code. A loop or function call becomes "hot" after **56 iterations** (configurable via `hotloop`), at which point LuaJIT records and compiles a trace. The compiled machine code cache can grow up to **~2 MB** (`maxmcode = 2048 KB`). This JIT compilation **increases Lua memory usage** as compiled traces are stored. This is normal, expected behavior — not a memory leak. Since every addon running in `d3d_present` at 60fps will trigger JIT compilation quickly, most growth alerts from MemScope are false positives. The alerts are disabled by default for this reason. (See [LuaJIT Running](https://luajit.org/running.html) for full JIT parameters.)

## Technical Notes

### Addon List Capture

Per-addon memory data comes from silently injecting `/addon list` and intercepting the chat output in the `text_in` event. The capture system:
- Pre-allocates result buffer (no per-capture allocation)
- Strips FFXI color codes before pattern matching
- Uses `seen_data` flag to avoid premature footer detection from startup notifications
- Timeout safety (2 seconds) prevents hanging on missed footer
- Only blocks chat lines during active capture; normal addon notifications pass through

### Memory Data Sources

| Metric | Source | Scope |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Working Set | K32GetProcessMemoryInfo (FFI) | Entire FFXI process |
| Page File | K32GetProcessMemoryInfo (FFI) | Entire FFXI process |
| System RAM | GlobalMemoryStatusEx (FFI) | System-wide |
| Own Lua State | collectgarbage('count') | This addon's Lua VM only |
| Own Tracked | addon.instance:get\_memory\_usage() | This addon only |
| Per-Addon | /addon list capture | All loaded addons |

### Performance Design
- **Ring buffers**: O(1) push, fixed-size, no reallocation after init
- **Object pool**: 64 pre-allocated addon tracking slots, no GC pressure
- **Chart buffers**: Pre-allocated arrays filled in-place each frame
- **Action flags**: UI sets flags, d3d_present processes them (decouples rendering from logic)
- **Safe text_in**: Never print() from text_in handler (causes recursive crash); uses debug buffer flushed from d3d_present

## Version History

### v1.0.1
- Renamed `leak_threshold` setting to `growth_threshold` (consistent with reframed "growth" language)
- Added `Auto GC Monitoring` checkbox to Settings UI (was only configurable via settings file)
